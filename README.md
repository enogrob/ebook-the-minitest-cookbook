# eBook The Minitest Cookbook by Chris Kotton

![ebook image](assets/ebook.png)

**About**

If you want to use even the most simple tool effectively, you need to know how to hold it. The Minitest Cookbook has been written to help Ruby and Rails developers at all skill levels master the techniques they need to write clear, maintainable tests and help others to do the same.  Using Minitest, of course.

This edition has been updated to include changes in the latest version of Minitest (5.9.1) and Rails 5.
